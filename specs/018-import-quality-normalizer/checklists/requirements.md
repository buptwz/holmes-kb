# Specification Quality Checklist: Import Pipeline Quality Normalization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- 4 user stories map directly to 4 root causes from v15 usage report
- US1 (Normalizer) and US2 (Schema) are tightly coupled — schema expansion feeds into Normalizer's category normalization
- US3 (Skill generation) and US4 (DocumentClassifier) are fully independent of each other and of US1/US2
- All success criteria are verifiable via automated test assertions
